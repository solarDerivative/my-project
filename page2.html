					<p><em>&emsp;How to upgrade the Edit Table? I don't have a solid idea yet, but I'm thinking of taking user input and setting it as a global variable... we'll see what happens.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Note to self: Now that I'm a month in, I've got to stop taking week-long breaks. There is too much to learn!
					<p>&emsp;EDIT: 7 hours later: Done! It feels so great to write a for loop, not because you've Googled hints, but because you UNDERSTAND that using a for loop would help you accomplish whatever behavior you're aiming for. I'm really excited about the script I managed to make work - I didn't think it was going to end up being so easy for me to figure out without having to start learning an outside library.</em>
					<hr>
					<p><em>Changes made in AM</em></p>
					<h3>Global</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Navbar content no longer in container class, spans entire screen width</li>
							<li>Made border using CSS to separate "My Project" from menu elements</li>
						</ul>
					<br>
					<em>Changes made in PM</em>
					<h3>Sandbox</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>HELLOOOOOO USER:</strong> Edit Table <strong>UPGRADED</strong>! Now there is an empty prompt where you may enter a username. The username is locally stored and will show up in the header across the entire site. So exciting! Unfortunately I'm not 100% on the properties of localStorage. I will have to figure that one out</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Global</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>^ :</strong> "Welcome back, (username(in caps!))" added to right side of navbar</li>
							<li>Border added next to it as well</li>
						</ul>
					<p><em>&emsp;To-Do list from here is pretty big, left some loose ends in setting up this script. I found that Bootstrap really got in my way when trying to get the Username part into the navbar, so I'd like to scrap the current navbar and make a new one from scratch.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Seeing the username prompt and the slideshow next to each other on the Sandbox gives me some ideas... like making it so that a user can set a "profile picture" using the picture slideshow. With a name and a photo, they could then "write a review" and be featured just like the "reviews" on the home page. Yeah?? I think accomplishing that (if able) will be my "Final Project" for Javascript, proof to myself that I'm ready to move on.</p>

					<h3>Home</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A Home page where I refreshed myself on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS</li>
							<li>A Home page that I made with a freshly-downloaded Sublime Text Editor</li>
							<li>A Home page that I used to learn about Bootstrap, which made for a very stress-free introduction to self-taught web development</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Blog</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A personal record of everything I've learned, maintained and updated every day that I've worked on this project</li>
							<li>A way of organizing every post so as to not have a colossal wall of text for a page</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Sandbox</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A page dedicated to experimentation and learning, at first created to try and create the Blog's "accordion" functionality without the risk of messing with the page's content</li>
							<li>Then used as an empty slate to write on as I followed Javascript tutorials</li>
							<li>And now the results of those simple tutorials are starting points to learn how to code things more complicated on my own</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Github</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>And finally, a <a href="https://github.com/solarDerivative/my-project">repository</a> for all of my things!</li>

					<p><em>&emsp;I plan to keep going. My hope is that, in the near future, I am competent enough to make this a career path for myself.

							<li><strong>YES! I FIGURED IT OUT:</strong> I was looking over my two functions, <code>plusDivs(n)</code> and <code>showDivs(n)</code>, wondering why "n" was behaving the way it was. And then it occurred to me that I don't ever "declare" <code>n</code> as a variable, or at least not in the "traditional" sense (right? excuse my misunderstanding of terminology, I'm still getting there). So then, <code>n</code> might not be static - not even referring to the same thing - across these two functions.</li>
							<li><strong>Parameters:</strong> (<em>I promise I knew and understood these terms back when I learned them in high school...</em>) Anyway, once that thought occurred to me, I wanted to find out more about the properties of whatever it is you're putting in those function's parentheses. Found <a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/java5/Notes/chap34A/ch34A_3.html">here</a>:</li>
								<ul><li><strong>formal parameter:</strong> the identifier used in a method to stand for the value that is passed into the method by a caller</li>
								<li><strong>actual parameter:</strong> the actual value that is passed into the method by a caller</li></ul>
							<li><code>(n)</code><strong>'s All the Way Down (alt. A Tale of Two</strong> <code>(n)</code><strong>'s:</strong>  Identifier used IN a method to stand for the value THAT IS PASSED INTO the method. I had been treating the <code>n</code> of <code>plusDivs(n)</code> and the <code>n</code> of <code>showDivs(n)</code> as the same thing. By changing <code>showDivs(n)</code> to <code>showDivs(k)</code> and all instances of <code>n</code> inside that method to <code>k</code>, I was able to find out for sure that they were completely different things. Mystery solved!</li>

						<p><em>&emsp;So my next "tutorial-less upgrade project" was to change the "Pictures" widget on the Sandbox to where, instead of clicking text to show an image, it would be one of those shideshows where you can click to show the next or previous image. My process was to <strong>1)</strong> research the basic functioning Javascript to make it work, <strong>2)</strong> edit the HTML and CSS so I liked the soon-to-be end product, then <strong>3)</strong> delete the Javascript then re-write it in a way that makes sense to me.<p>
						&emsp;I got it mostly done, but needed to cheat for some of the details. I added the details, and the slideshow worked just fine. But looking back over the code as a whole, I didn't fully understand what was happening on every single line. I commented-out some bits and pieces so that I could see exactly how each function and loop was working at any given time. And that was good.<p>
						<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nyxvxgv.png"></p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPMpwdl.png"><p></center>
						&emsp;Now, I've hit a point where I have no idea what is going on. The way the code is commented out, on the slideshow (comprised of 3 images) you can click the <strong>Next</strong> button as many times as you want, and after the 3rd/last image in the array nothing will appear, and <code>n += 1</code> each time, so <code>n</code> can go as high as you want. On the flip side, when you click the <strong>Previous</strong> button, it will cycle through the images without returning nothing (intended behavior), and will -1 each time, but when it <strong>should</strong> hit -3, it resets to 0 instead. (0, -1, -2, 0, -1, -2, 0, etc)<p>
						&emsp;The way I've described it, it seems to make sense: <strong>Previous</strong> cycles through the array correctly, so <code>n</code> gets reset when you go from the (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></span><u>1</u> 2 3) first position to the (1 2 <u>3</u><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></span>) last position of the array. <strong>Next</strong> does NOT cycle through the array correctly, it will stop showing images after you (1 2 3<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>) move past the last image.<p>
						&emsp;What I'm not getting is, why is it <code>n</code> that's being reset like this? As far as I can tell from my code, <code>n -= 1</code> when <strong>Previous</strong> is clicked and <code>n += 1</code> whenever <strong>Next</strong> is clicked. There's nothing in my code that I can see trying to change or set the value of <code>n</code> outside of its (+= 1 / -= 1) behavior. I have variable <code>slideIndex</code> that is supposed to be the variable that is acted upon and reset whenever the user cycles through the array (or so I thought).<p>
						&emsp;This one will take some figuring out! I am not moving on until this code makes absolute sense to me.</em></p>

								<li>Created custom panels (widgets) inspired by Bootstrap's premade panels</li>
								<li>Aligned panels using grid classes, alignment will change based on screen width. Added hover functionality to panels, a shadow will highlight position of mouse</li>
								<li>Added jumbotron. "Check Out The Reviews!", title salvaged from lowest cleverness-threshold sector of brain, decided to use this theme as a template of sorts for future features, such as...</li>
								<li>Moving widgets into jumbotron, used, uh, "review" lingo as filler text. In future this concept could translate to preview slides of a marquee, or interactive "highlights" of an otherwise static cover screen. Not too shabby... TODO: Push this further</li>
								<li>Incorporating stock images to experiment with media-text coupling. Possible implementations could include message forum avatars, blog post previews, "about the author". Useful to know</li>
								<li> Used img-circle class to make images circles. Drew borders around images. Looks neat, border isn't seamless, weird pixel fraying around inner side of border. Possibly layering issue, keep eye out for solutions</li>
								<li>Added opacity feature to images. Images at 80% opacity by default, hovering over the image will up opacity to 100% all fluid-like. Documenting potentially unhealthy infatuation with this functionality as early as possible, just in case</li>
								<li>Deleted useless panel at bottom of page, un-deleted useless panel at bottom of page, repurposed as Patch Notes section. Plan to document learning process, this panel is prototype for blog. TODO: move patch notes to test page</li>
