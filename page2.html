					<em><p>&emsp;Before yesterday, I thought I still had a decent ways to go to this project nearing completion. But then I breezed through those two scripts in one day - apparently, I overestimated how long it'd take me to figure those things out.</p>
					<p>&emsp;So, as far as functionality and appearances go, I would expect ReviewCrews to be pretty much done this time next month. Maybe even sooner? After it looks and feels the way I want it to, I'm going to try and re-do most or all the code. Throughout the learning process the most important thing for me to figure out has been getting things to work, which has been a process of snowballing parts onto the projects. So what I need to learn next is coding <strong>well</strong>. Getting the most done with as few lines of code as possible, making sure my code is open, flexible, adaptable. Consolidating repetition, and so on.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Having taken a cumulative seven years or so of Spanish classes, I guess the transition is like, okay, you've been studying and studying and now you know a good amount of vocabulary, you understand verb conjugation and most grammatical rules, and you can do these things on paper by yourself just fine given the time. So, to really put yourself to the test, you've got to have - you've got to maintain a conversation with somebody. You've got to keep up with others and adapt what you've learned to different contexts in real-time.</p>
					<p>&emsp;I mean, it's all language, and society didn't develop language so that people could talk to themselves.</p>
					<br>
					<p>You know, kind of like...</p>
					<p>...what I'm doing with this blog?</p>

					<p><em>&emsp;Beginning to think bigger... maybe I should go all the way with the "RNG-Twitter" idea? Put the website online, allow the website to permanently store user input and do what the home page currently does. Certainly an inspired project that serves a purpose will be more fulfilling and will look better on a resume? Maybe I should focus on reaching a stopping point with this project and learn a framework first...? It's a pretty cool idea though!</em></p>

					<em><p>&emsp;Duuuuude OK. So I was looking at all the code that I wrote recently, and so far I've ended up with three functions that "get user input at a location and store it locally" and two and a half functions that "show stored local content at at least one location".</p>
					<p>&emsp;And I'm looking at it going, OK, I should be able to consolidate all of this, right? Basically have one "get" function that works for whatever wants to use it, and have a "show" function that works for whatever wants to use it?</p>
					<p>&emsp;So "good code" means (in part) not repeating yourself, so I figured I'd try and hit this up as my next big goal. And, well. Oof.</p>
					<p>&emsp;So far this is looking more complicated than anything I've done so far, since there are many moving parts within each function, so it's not as simple as mushing three into one. I also have to figure out what to do all of the extraneous stuff.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Hmm. So yeah! This is my next goal. Pretty excited to hit another roadblock. Maybe I'm not at close to plateauing with this project as it seemed!</p></em>

					<p>&emsp;In other words, in an array that looks like <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</code>, I made code that randomly selects 3 and displays them. The 3 selected would show up as <code>[0, 2, 4]</code> or <code>[0, 1, 5]</code>, for example. Always in order of lowest index number to highest index number.

					<br>
					<p>&emsp;Haha, but really, at 10:00 AM it started out as a casual observation about how time waits for no man and that progress is the tool with which we are able to keep pace... and about 15 minutes ago, 3:00 PM, I had I guess like 50-75% of this huge essay going into the concept of perfectionism and its implications on people from the personal level to societal to species-wide, and how the foundation of most religions is based on the personal pursuit of perfection, and pointed out the similarities between modern criticisms of many religions and perfection, oh good grief it was a mess. Was about to finally make my point (I think?) about how perfection as an objective concept (common view of perfectionism is laced with personal ambitions and desires), specifically citing time as the most observable example of a perfect system (time, as relevant and observable to the average person - disregard relativity), establishing objective perfection as a self-referential concept, steering away from the context of "without flaw" and more geared towards</p>

							<li><strong>Hopefully This Doesn't Look Too Edgy:</strong> CSS overhauled to create a cohesive style, from class structure to fonts, colors, and other attributes</li>
							<li><strong>Just One Problem:</strong> I may have pointed this out already, but it seems like the navbar on this page is one extra pixel taller than it is on the other two pages. Right now I have no idea why.</li>
							<li>Entries under June were not *fully* updated to represent the new CSS. This goes back to my idea of the Blog being representative of my growth. It could also end up being the case that the inconsistency bothers me later and I go back and update everything... shrug?</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Global</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Collateral Damage:</strong> The Home and Sandbox pages were left a little unruly-looking in certain spots while I focused on the blog. This is because I updated the CSS for a couple of frequently-used styles - headers like <code>h3</code> and <code>h4</code> especially. Having those building blocks already sitting on those pages will definitely expedite re-building the style around those pages.</li>
							<li><strong>Navbar:</strong> Finally figured out the CSS sorcery involved in allowing the welcome message area to be set apart from the links in terms of styling. The struggle of getting the welcome message to stop being highlighted on <code>hover</code> was real. To this point there seems to be a big difference between <code>.class .anotherclass{}</code> and <code>.class.anotherClass{}</code> in CSS, seeing as I've been able to do things with the latter that I struggled to figure out with the former. I'll need to look into what this syntax means.</li>

					<h3>Sandbox</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>I Thought I Already Took Care Of This Lol:</strong> Fixed an error with the calculator where it would return an unexpected message when trying to divide by zero
							<ul><li><em>TODO</em>: I guess I could still try and figure out how to display a unique message when the calculator would otherwise return "NaN". Spent some time on it when I addressed (or so I thought) the divide by zero issue but didn't come up with a working solution</li></ul></li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Home</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>No changes made to Home, but
							<ul><li><em>TODO</em>: Write script that automatically fills the "Lastest Post" spot with the latest post on the Blog, instead of me having to remember to write it in every time. Got a pretty clear idea of how I would do it, so I'll give it a shot.</li></ul>

						&emsp;Right. Anyway! The first post was made June 1st. Today is June 30th. I've been at it for a full month! So, to recap... well, I have gone from 0, literally nothing, to:</em></p>
					<h3>Home</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A Home page where I refreshed myself on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS</li>
							<li>A Home page that I made with a freshly-downloaded Sublime Text Editor</li>
							<li>A Home page that I used to learn about Bootstrap, which made for a very stress-free introduction to self-taught web development</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Blog</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A personal record of everything I've learned, maintained and updated every day that I've worked on this project</li>
							<li>A way of organizing every post so as to not have a colossal wall of text for a page</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Sandbox</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A page dedicated to experimentation and learning, at first created to try and create the Blog's "accordion" functionality without the risk of messing with the page's content</li>
							<li>Then used as an empty slate to write on as I followed Javascript tutorials</li>
							<li>And now the results of those simple tutorials are starting points to learn how to code things more complicated on my own</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Github</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>And finally, a <a href="https://github.com/solarDerivative/my-project">repository</a> for all of my things!</li>
						</ul>
					<p><em>&emsp;I plan to keep going. My hope is that, in the near future, I am competent enough to make this a career path for myself. I'd like to look back on this post next June and be happy that I made this opportunity for myself. So, in the interest of being able to do that, back to work!</em>

							<li><strong>YES! I FIGURED IT OUT:</strong> I was looking over my two functions, <code>plusDivs(n)</code> and <code>showDivs(n)</code>, wondering why "n" was behaving the way it was. And then it occurred to me that I don't ever "declare" <code>n</code> as a variable, or at least not in the "traditional" sense (right? excuse my misunderstanding of terminology, I'm still getting there). So then, <code>n</code> might not be static - not even referring to the same thing - across these two functions.</li>
							<li><strong>Parameters:</strong> (<em>I promise I knew and understood these terms back when I learned them in high school...</em>) Anyway, once that thought occurred to me, I wanted to find out more about the properties of whatever it is you're putting in those function's parentheses. Found <a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/java5/Notes/chap34A/ch34A_3.html">here</a>:</li>
								<ul><li><strong>formal parameter:</strong> the identifier used in a method to stand for the value that is passed into the method by a caller</li>
								<li><strong>actual parameter:</strong> the actual value that is passed into the method by a caller</li></ul>
							<li><code>(n)</code><strong>'s All the Way Down (alt. A Tale of Two</strong> <code>(n)</code><strong>'s:</strong>  Identifier used IN a method to stand for the value THAT IS PASSED INTO the method. I had been treating the <code>n</code> of <code>plusDivs(n)</code> and the <code>n</code> of <code>showDivs(n)</code> as the same thing. By changing <code>showDivs(n)</code> to <code>showDivs(k)</code> and all instances of <code>n</code> inside that method to <code>k</code>, I was able to find out for sure that they were completely different things. Mystery solved!</li>

						<p><em>&emsp;So my next "tutorial-less upgrade project" was to change the "Pictures" widget on the Sandbox to where, instead of clicking text to show an image, it would be one of those shideshows where you can click to show the next or previous image. My process was to <strong>1)</strong> research the basic functioning Javascript to make it work, <strong>2)</strong> edit the HTML and CSS so I liked the soon-to-be end product, then <strong>3)</strong> delete the Javascript then re-write it in a way that makes sense to me.<p>
						&emsp;I got it mostly done, but needed to cheat for some of the details. I added the details, and the slideshow worked just fine. But looking back over the code as a whole, I didn't fully understand what was happening on every single line. I commented-out some bits and pieces so that I could see exactly how each function and loop was working at any given time. And that was good.<p>
						<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nyxvxgv.png"></p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPMpwdl.png"><p></center>
						&emsp;Now, I've hit a point where I have no idea what is going on. The way the code is commented out, on the slideshow (comprised of 3 images) you can click the <strong>Next</strong> button as many times as you want, and after the 3rd/last image in the array nothing will appear, and <code>n += 1</code> each time, so <code>n</code> can go as high as you want. On the flip side, when you click the <strong>Previous</strong> button, it will cycle through the images without returning nothing (intended behavior), and will -1 each time, but when it <strong>should</strong> hit -3, it resets to 0 instead. (0, -1, -2, 0, -1, -2, 0, etc)<p>
						&emsp;The way I've described it, it seems to make sense: <strong>Previous</strong> cycles through the array correctly, so <code>n</code> gets reset when you go from the (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></span><u>1</u> 2 3) first position to the (1 2 <u>3</u><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></span>) last position of the array. <strong>Next</strong> does NOT cycle through the array correctly, it will stop showing images after you (1 2 3<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>) move past the last image.<p>
						&emsp;What I'm not getting is, why is it <code>n</code> that's being reset like this? As far as I can tell from my code, <code>n -= 1</code> when <strong>Previous</strong> is clicked and <code>n += 1</code> whenever <strong>Next</strong> is clicked. There's nothing in my code that I can see trying to change or set the value of <code>n</code> outside of its (+= 1 / -= 1) behavior. I have variable <code>slideIndex</code> that is supposed to be the variable that is acted upon and reset whenever the user cycles through the array (or so I thought).<p>
						&emsp;This one will take some figuring out! I am not moving on until this code makes absolute sense to me.</em></p>
